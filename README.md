# Proximity sensor for the blind
This project measures distance with a VL53L1 sensor and translates the measurements to tactile feedback (frequency of taps on finger) as a tool to help blind people find objects and navigate their surroundings.

Thank you to Nathan Seidle of SparkFun for the VL53L1X Arduino Library we use in this code (the source code for the library can be found at https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_VL53L1X_Arduino_Library :)
